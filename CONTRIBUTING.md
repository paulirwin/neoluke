# Contributing to NeoLuke

Thanks for contributing to my little project!

To get started, first make sure there is an issue for what you want to do, and ask to be assigned to it.
I might reject unsolicited PRs for missing or unassigned issues, or if someone else is assigned to the issue.

If there is not an issue for what you want to do, feel free to create one.
Once created, if you also volunteer to fix it, indicate as such in the issue, and I'll assign it to you.

When creating a PR, always create it from a branch on your fork _other than_ `main`.
Following the format `issue/123` where 123 is the issue number is a good pattern to follow.
Make sure your branch is rebased against latest `main` before submitting the PR.

If you used AI to help you make the change (apart from simple code completion in an IDE), make sure
the AI is included as a co-author of at least one of your commits.

Please enable the checkbox when creating the PR to allow for edits by maintainers.
I might choose to jump in and make small changes instead of having a lot of back-and-forth and making you fix things.

Thanks again, and I look forward to working with you on your contribution!
